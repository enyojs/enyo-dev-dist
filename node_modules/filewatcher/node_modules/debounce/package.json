  "readme": "\n# debounce\n\n  Useful for implementing behavior that should only happen after a repeated action has completed.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ component install component/debounce\n\n  Or in node:\n\n    $ npm install debounce\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar debounce = require('debounce');\nwindow.onresize = debounce(resize, 200);\n\nfunction resize(e) {\n  console.log('height', window.innerHeight);\n  console.log('width', window.innerWidth);\n}\n```\n\n## API\n\n### debounce(fn, wait, [ immediate || false ])\n\n  Creates and returns a new debounced version of the passed function that will postpone its execution until after wait milliseconds have elapsed since the last time it was invoked.\n\n  Pass `true` for the `immediate` parameter to cause debounce to trigger the function on the leading edge instead of the trailing edge of the wait interval. Useful in circumstances like preventing accidental double-clicks on a \"submit\" button from firing a second time.\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n\n  Original implementation is from [`underscore.js`](http://underscorejs.org/)\n  which also has an MIT license.\n",
